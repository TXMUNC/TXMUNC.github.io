<h2>To test the iEMA platform</h2>

<p>
This link <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUL8jDAmkZPDOJm7DKTRVPacsY8yaTx5j734QIQj-h5JS2yQ/viewform?usp=pp_url">iEMAtest</a>
shows a google survey form to register your phone number for testing the adaptive feature of iEMA platform. This iEMA test feature is not open to public 
but only to researchers who have contacted us for such a test. Here is how to proceed: 

<ol>
<li>After a phone number is registered, we will evaluate whether this is a valid initial registration.</li>
<li>Then (if we decide that the initial registration is valid), a text message with a one-time-passcode (OTP) will be sent to this registered phone number</li>
<li>The tester who receives this OTP should update the google form registration with this OTP to complete this registration.</li>
</ol>

After completing the registration, the user will receive, twice per day for up to 5 days, text messages each with a link to a survey which contains an adaptive list of questions.   

</p>

<h2>iEMA demonstration with a hypothetical dataset</h2>

<p>
This link leads you to a R shinny app that demonstrates the application of a predictive model on a hypothetical EMA dataset. 
<br/>

This R shinny app will show the predictive values and prediction errors for responses to future surveys based on responses collected before 
that each future survey. 
<br/>

We are actively updating this app. Please contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.
